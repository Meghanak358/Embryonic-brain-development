# 🌟 Embryonic Brain Cell Development Web Portal

A comprehensive educational web application designed to track and display the stages of embryonic brain development. This project utilizes a **PHP-based architecture** with a **Bootstrap frontend** to provide a responsive, user-friendly experience for students, researchers, or medical professionals.

## 🔥 Features

* **✅ Educational Content:** Detailed breakdown of the six stages of development: Fertilization, Cleavage, Blastocyst Formation, Gastrulation, Neural Development, and Organogenesis.
* **🖼️ Dynamic Image Gallery:** Visual representations of neural plate formation, neural tube development, and brain regions.
* **🎥 Multimedia Integration:** Embedded video resources and instructional YouTube content explaining embryonic transitions.
* **📋 Patient Management System:** Dedicated interfaces for adding and viewing patient data for authorized users.
* **🔐 Authentication Flow:** Integrated registration and login modules for secure access.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into modular PHP and HTML components for easier maintenance:

* **home.php / home.html:** The main landing page featuring development stages and a visual gallery.
* **index.html:** An "About" section focusing on regional specialization, neurogenesis, and synaptogenesis.
* **header.php:** Standard navigation for guests (Login/Register).
* **headder_l.php:** Enhanced navigation for logged-in users, including patient data management links.
* **Images:** Contains anatomical diagrams such as the Neural Tube (`em3.jpg`), Brain Regions (`em4.jpg`), and Synaptogenesis (`em7.jpg`).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4.5.2.
* **Backend:** PHP.
* **Scripts:** jQuery, Popper.js.

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/embryo-dev-portal.git

```


2. **Set up a local server:** Ensure you have a local PHP environment (like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP) installed.
3. **Move files:** Place the project folder inside your `htdocs` or `www` directory.
4. **Access the site:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/embryo-dev-portal/home.php`.
