#Embryonic Brain Cell Development Web Portal

A comprehensive educational web application designed to track and display the stages of embryonic brain development. This project utilizes a PHP-based architecture with a Bootstrap frontend to provide a responsive, user-friendly experience for students, researchers, or medical professionals.
🌟 Features

    Educational Content: Detailed breakdown of the six stages of development: Fertilization, Cleavage, Blastocyst Formation, Gastrulation, Neural Development, and Organogenesis.

    Dynamic Image Gallery: Visual representations of neural plate formation, neural tube development, and synaptogenesis.

    Multimedia Integration: Embedded video resources and instructional YouTube content explaining embryonic transitions.

    Patient Management System: Includes dedicated interfaces for adding and viewing patient data (linked via headder_l.php).

    Authentication Flow: Integrated registration and login modules for secure access.

📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into modular PHP components for easier maintenance:

    home.php / home.html: The main landing page featuring development stages and a visual gallery.

    index.html: An "About" section focusing on regional specialization and neurogenesis.

    header.php: Standard navigation for guests (Login/Register).

    headder_l.php: Enhanced navigation for logged-in users, including patient data management links.

    /assets: Contains anatomical diagrams such as the Neural Tube (em3.jpg), Brain Regions (em4.jpg), and Synaptogenesis (em7.jpg).

🛠️ Technology Stack

    Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4.5.2.

    Backend: PHP.

    Scripts: jQuery, Popper.js.
